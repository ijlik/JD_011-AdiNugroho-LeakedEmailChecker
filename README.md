   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ijlik/JD_011-AdiNugroho-LeakedEmailChecker.git
   cd JD_011-AdiNugroho-LeakedEmailChecker
   ```

   - Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right corner

3. **Load the Extension**

   - Find "Leaked Email Checker" and click the pin icon to keep it visible

## Usage

### Method 1: Popup Scanner
1. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar
2. Click "Scan page for emails" button
3. The extension will scan the current page for email addresses
